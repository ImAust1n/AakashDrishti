"""Heuristic disaster-management decision-support layers.

Every function here produces DECISION-SUPPORT SUGGESTIONS ONLY, derived
from real pixel statistics on the estimated DSM/rDSM and building
footprints -- none of these are certified surveys, and none should be
presented as authoritative for actual emergency operations without expert
review and ground-truthing. This module exists to demonstrate the kind of
analysis AakashDrishti's height data enables (research-notes.md
"differentiating USPs"), not to replace real disaster-response planning.

Coordinate handling reuses the same affine-transform convention as
`app/dsm/generate.py` / `app/geospatial/raster_io.py`: `geo.transform` is a
GDAL-style 6-tuple consumed via `rasterio.Affine(*geo.transform)`. Pixel
spacing in meters reuses the geographic/projected-CRS approximation from
`app/mesh/generate.py::_geo_pixel_spacing_meters` (imported directly rather
than reimplemented) when `geo` is available; otherwise slope is expressed
per pixel-unit rather than per meter (not geographically calibrated, but
never a fabricated conversion factor).

    transform comment) -- i.e. a real, guaranteed-obstacle-free circular
    area, not an independently-measured rectangle. A plane needs a long,
    narrow strip, which this heuristic cannot actually detect (it only finds
    the best circular clearing); the safe, honest translation is to require
    the clearing to be big enough to contain a square of side
    `required_length_m` INSCRIBED IN THE CIRCLE (side = diameter / sqrt(2)),

    guarantees the reported footprint is geometrically contained within the
    verified-clear area, at the cost of being a much stricter (and much
    less often satisfied) plane-fit check than before -- more accurate, not
    a regression.

    `fits` and the margins are `None` (never guessed) when `width_m`/
    `length_m` are `None` -- i.e. the job has no real pixel spacing to
    measure the zone in meters, so aircraft fit is genuinely unknown rather
